Plugins automatically reload on save.  You can edit your plugin's
code right in sublime and try out your changes immediately.  It's
an amazingly satisfying environment.


At a bare minimum, all programming environments need logging output.
Sublime outputs python print statements to the python console.
  print "Selection: " + repr(view.sel())


Open a console and paste this in to have every command printed:
  sublime.log_commands(True)


To print the current syntax file:
  view.settings().get('syntax')
And the syntax scope / theme selector:
  view.syntax_name(view.sel()[0].begin())
  sublime.set_clipboard(view.syntax_name(view.sel()[0].a))
  OR just hit Control-Shift-P


How are settings found?

  Global Settings
  Package Settings   -- Vintage/Preferences.sublime-settings
  Platform Settings  -- Vintage/Preferences (OSX).sublime-settings
  User Settings      -- User/Preferences.sublime-settings


Packages/Default/*.sublime-keymap  (then platform)
PKG/*.sublime-keymap   (then platform)
Packages/User/*.sublime-keymap (then platform)

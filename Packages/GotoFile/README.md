## GotoFile Sublime Text Plugin

Quickly navigate to the filename under cursor.

Command-Option-P works just like Command-P, but fills in the word
under the cursor.


### Installation

Package Control -> Add Repository and add this repository,
then Package Controll -> Install and install GotoFile.

Otherwise, just clone it into your Packages directory.


### TODO

TODO: make the filename regular expression extensible
TODO: find most relevant file including extensions and open it immediatley
TODO: context menu?

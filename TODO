Is sublime-last-edit any good?  Change-List is interesting but only
stays in the same file: http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=10044


TODO:

- I'll probably want this: https://github.com/alienhard/SublimeAllAutocomplete
- Add BracketHighlighter?  https://github.com/facelessuser/BracketHighlighter/tree/BH2
- Make sure every plugin adds itself to the Preferences menu and
  can be configured the same way.
- Extract Rails Partial. This is kind of similar: https://github.com/wesf90/rails-partial
- Undo Tree / Gundo is definitely sorely missing
- Control-A and Control-X (increase/decrease # under cursor) would be awesome in Vintage.

- would be nice if sublime sidebar supported typeahead find.


NOTDO:

- FindKeyConflicts is great in theory but it produces hundreds of false positives.  Not useful untiil this is fixed.
  Better would probably be a KeyReport plugin that would list keys sorted by keystroke or by command and let user interpret context/conflicts.
- Tomorrow Theme (actually color scheme): hate the additional submenu, themes aren't very different from defaults

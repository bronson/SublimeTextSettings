Is sublime-last-edit any good?  Change-List is interesting but only
stays in the same file: http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=10044


TODO:

- Visual block mode is key.  Fuuuuuuu, how does Vintage not include this?
- Why are U and Control-R so buggy?  Don't they map directly to undo and redo?  (perhaps with count?)
- Vintage textobjects: line , _ Ruby-block space
- I'll probably want this: https://github.com/alienhard/SublimeAllAutocomplete
- Add BracketHighlighter?  https://github.com/facelessuser/BracketHighlighter/tree/BH2
- Make sure every plugin adds itself to the Preferences menu and
  can be configured the same way.
- Extract Rails Partial. This is kind of similar: https://github.com/wesf90/rails-partial
- Undo Tree / Gundo is definitely sorely missing
- Any way of porting endwise so ruby end statements are reliably inserted?  (don't see much sense in using snippets here but whatev)
  - matchit would be nice too.  % bouncing between begin/if/rescue/end/etc would be hot.
- Control-A and Control-X (increase/decrease # under cursor) would be awesome in Vintage.

- Alignment, there are some silly bugs in this package.
  - want two keystrokes: auto align, and declare what to align by
    - declare would prompt for the separators to use.
  - needs to have unit tests with examples.

- would be nice if sublime sidebar supported typeahead find.
- how about a snippet discovery tool?  when it sees you something that could have been snippeted, it tells you
  meh, that sounds irritating.  what about just highlighting potential snippets in the current file?


NOTDO:

- FindKeyConflicts is great in theory but it produces hundreds of false positives.  Not useful untiil this is fixed.
  Better would probably be a KeyReport plugin that would list keys sorted by keystroke or by command and let user interpret context/conflicts.
- Tomorrow Theme (actually color scheme): hate the additional submenu, themes aren't very different from defaults
